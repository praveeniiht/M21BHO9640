1. Write a java program to read a number and check whether it is prime number or not?

2. Write a program to reverse the given the number.

3. Write a program to perform matrix addtion for 2x2 matrices.

4. Write a program to read a string and count the number of vowels in it.

5. write a program to find the given string is  pallindrome or not?



1. Scanner class  -- util package
2. BufferedReader class

Features of OOPS
------------------------
1. class  -- It is the collection of objects having the similar properties.
Logical entity

data and methods


ears, legs, nose, hands;


class HumanBein
		
		walking(){
		
		}
		eating(){
		
		}
		sleeping(){
		
		}
	}


2. Object  --  It is an instance of the class 
Physical entity

The class will exists in the form of objects.
y = mx+c
 y = 4x+9
 
 
 3. Encapsulation: Wrapping up of data in single unit.
 The process of combining the both data and methods in a single unit called class. 
 is used for abstraction.
 
Abstraction : is selective hiding and selective display

Inheritacne: It is process of acquring the features from one entity to anther entity.
For code resuability

Relations:

Is-a  -- Inheritacne

Has-a  -- We shall pass one class object as a parameter to another class method.

Uses --  We shall use one class object into another class directly.
class Address{
	int dno;
	String street, city, state , pin;
}

class Person{
	string name, id;
	public displayData(Address address)
	{
	// display all the data, name, id, dno, state, street,pin
	}
}


		
class Person{
	string name, id;
	Address address;
}   losely coupled code.

	

class Person  extends Address {
		String name;
		String id;
		
}

class Employee  extends Address {
	String empname;
	String dept;
	
}








3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance
5. Abstraction
6. Polymorphism  : 

We will identify every object by its behaviour only, so if we group the objects with same behaviour then
that group is called class.

Polymorphism: The ability of an entity to exists in more than one form.

Runtime : Overriding - Method, Data
Compile  -- Method Overloading.

Two or more methods are said to be overloaded, iff they have same method names and differ in 
any one of the following;
1. Either in the number of parameters
2. Either in the type of parametes
3. Either in the order of parameters


class Jdbc{

    public void loadDriver(){    // load the driver code  }
	public void doConnection(int a, int b){   }
	public void getData(int a, char b){  }
	public void closeConnections(char a, char b){  }
	static{
			class.forName("drivename");
	}
}

clas Jdbc{
	public void test(int a,int b){  }
	public int test(int a, int b) {  }
	public char test(int a, int b) [  }
}

class Jdbc{
		public void test(char d, int c){ }
		public  void test(char a, int b){  }
	}
	
	Jdbc jdbc = new Jdbc();
	jdbc.test('a','b');





class


1. Eror
2. It prints box
3. It calls the box class


Classnmae objname = new Classname();


when ever we create an object, memroy will allocated only to variables, ie data not for methods
When ever objects are created,
1. The .class file is loaded into memory  // static block will be executed.
2. intantiation
3. Initialization

instance variables 
method variables
static variables  --  
which can be applied on 3 levels
1. variables
2. method
3. block

If static is applied on a method, then that method can be called directly on the class without creating the object
